- Rethink the initial fetchShipments algoritm. Add multiple page loading on client side.
+ Add "filter history based on entries"
+ Remove delete button from history viewing. Should be on edit mode only.
- History viewing will need filtering fields also. Need to refactor.
+ Remove "SelectedDept" (now using "Query")
+ Sidebar company/dept as filter only, no redirects
- !! Shipment History data is not getting loaded sometimes
