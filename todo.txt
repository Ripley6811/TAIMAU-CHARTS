- Rethink the initial fetchShipments algoritm. Add multiple page loading on client side.
+ Add "filter history based on entries"
+ Remove delete button from history viewing. Should be on edit mode only.
+ History viewing will need filtering fields also. Need to refactor.
+ Remove "SelectedDept" (now using "Query")
+ Sidebar company/dept as filter only, no redirects
+ !! Shipment History data is not getting loaded sometimes
+ Prevent "default" shipment loading with LIMIT from overwriting previous query with co:dept
- With default set to entire year, might SLOW down when there is a years worth of data.
+ Switching TO charts doesn't show currently selected department data. Must click again.
- Do aggregation in Mongo instead of D3.nest, BUT just sending shipment list allows multiple pages to share data without reloading...
+ Sidebar sets query params and pushes it to store. let other pages react to query param changes.
+ Why fetchDepartments in componentWillMount instead of "need"?? BECAUSE AppSidebar is not called as a route but as a subcomponent of AppLayout.
+ Solve possible "race" problem in TemplatesView delete/create dispatches
