- Rethink the initial fetchShipments algoritm. Add multiple page loading on client side.
+ Add "filter history based on entries"
+ Remove delete button from history viewing. Should be on edit mode only.
- History viewing will need filtering fields also. Need to refactor.
+ Remove "SelectedDept" (now using "Query")
+ Sidebar company/dept as filter only, no redirects
+ !! Shipment History data is not getting loaded sometimes
- Prevent "default" shipment loading with LIMIT from overwriting previous query with co:dept
- With default set to entire year, might SLOW down when there is a years worth of data.
